## Abstract
Fine-tuning and in-context learning (ICL) are two prevalent methods in imbuing large language models with task-specific knowledge. It is commonly believed that fine-tuning can surpass ICL given sufficient training samples as it allows the model to adjust its internal parameters based on the data. However, this paper presents a counterintuitive finding: For tasks with implicit patterns, ICL captures these patterns significantly better than fine-tuning. We developed several datasets featuring implicit patterns, such as sequences determining answers through parity or identifying reducible terms in calculations. We then evaluated the modelsâ€™ understanding of these patterns under both fine-tuning and ICL across models ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters. The results indicate that models employing ICL can quickly grasp deep patterns and significantly improve accuracy. In contrast, fine-tuning, despite utilizing thousands of times more training samples than ICL, achieved only limited improvements. We also proposed circuit shift theory from a mechanistic interpretabilityâ€™s view to explain why ICL wins.
## Install Requirements
The following steps will guide you through the installation process.

First, create a Python virtual environment using e.g. Conda:
```shell
conda create -n iclvsft python=3.10
conda activate iclvsft
```

Next, install the package dependencies as follows:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will also need Flash Attention 2 installed (This is not neccesary, only for training acceleration), which can be done by running:

```shell
python -m pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```
## Training scripts
```shell
python finetune.py
```
## Evaluation
```shell
python test.py
```
